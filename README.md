This repository will contain scripts pertaining to pulling data from the BioProject, sequence QC, variant calling, and associated downstream analysis (BPP v4.0 and PHRAPL).

Scripts for BPP and PHRAPL will follow a similar structure to those found in the GitHub repository associated with the original publication in an attempt to replicate results: https://github.com/sjgaughran/tortoise-species-delimitation

For information on the samples included in this project, please go to the metadata folder. This folder contains the accession number list and the SRA metadata. Please note, these files occupy 590 GB of data, so you will need ample space to pull the fastq files and run the associated scripts for analysis.

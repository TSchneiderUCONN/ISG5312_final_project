This repository will contain scripts pertaining to pulling data from the BioProject, sequence QC, variant calling, and associated downstream analysis (BPP v4.0 and PHRAPL).

Scripts for BPP and PHRAPL will follow a similar structure to those found in the GitHub repository associated with the original publication in an attempt to replicate results: https://github.com/sjgaughran/tortoise-species-delimitation

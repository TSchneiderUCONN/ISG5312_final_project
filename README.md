This repository will contain scripts pertaining to pulling data from the BioProject, sequence QC, variant calling, and associated downstream analysis.

Data will be pulled from BioProject PRJNA761229.

For plotting the PCA in R, I have provided a txt file in scripts/07_analysis containing the code I used to read in the data and plot it in ggplot.

For information on the samples included in this project, please go to the metadata folder. This folder contains the accession number list and the SRA metadata. Please note, these files occupy 590 GB of space, so you will need ample storage to pull the fastq files and run the associated scripts for analysis.
